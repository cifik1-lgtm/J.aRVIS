# ArchiMate - Enterprise Architecture Modeling Language

## Overview
ArchiMate is an open and independent enterprise architecture modeling language maintained by The Open Group. It provides a uniform representation for describing, analyzing, and communicating enterprise architectures. ArchiMate is designed to be used alongside TOGAF — where TOGAF defines the process (ADM), ArchiMate provides the visual notation.

ArchiMate 3.2 organizes elements across **layers** (Business, Application, Technology) and **aspects** (Active Structure, Behavior, Passive Structure), with a Motivation extension and Strategy layer.

## Layer and Aspect Framework

ArchiMate's core framework is a grid of layers and aspects:

```
              Active Structure    Behavior           Passive Structure
             (Who/What)          (How)               (On What)

## Mapping ArchiMate to TOGAF ADM Phases

| TOGAF ADM Phase | ArchiMate Layer / Viewpoint |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Phase A: Architecture Vision | Motivation Viewpoint, high-level Layered Viewpoint |
| Phase B: Business Architecture | Business Layer elements, Organization Viewpoint |
| Phase C: Information Systems | Application Layer, Data Objects, Application Structure Viewpoint |
| Phase D: Technology Architecture | Technology Layer, Technology Viewpoint |
| Phase E-F: Opportunities & Migration | Layered Viewpoint with gap annotations |
| Phase G-H: Governance & Change | Implementation and Migration Viewpoint |

## Best Practices
- **Use the correct layer.** Do not model application concerns in the Business Layer or vice versa. Cross-layer connections should use serving or realization relationships.
- **Keep viewpoints focused.** Each diagram should use a single viewpoint. A Layered Viewpoint can show cross-layer dependencies, but avoid cramming all elements into one diagram.
- **Use relationships precisely.** ArchiMate relationships have specific semantics. Do not use "serving" when you mean "realization" — they convey different architectural meaning.
- **Color-code by layer.** Follow the standard color convention: yellow for Business, blue for Application, green for Technology. This provides instant visual orientation.
- **Start with the Layered Viewpoint.** When introducing an architecture to stakeholders, the Layered Viewpoint provides the best overview of how business is supported by applications and technology.
- **Model motivation first.** Before modeling structure, capture stakeholder goals, drivers, and requirements. This ensures architecture decisions are traceable to business rationale.
- **Pair with TOGAF.** ArchiMate provides the notation; TOGAF provides the process. Use ArchiMate diagrams as deliverables within TOGAF ADM phases.
- **Limit elements per diagram to 15-20.** Overcrowded diagrams lose communicative value. Split into multiple viewpoints if needed.
- **Name elements with precision.** Use clear, specific names (e.g., "Order Management Service" not "Service 1"). Element names should be self-explanatory.
- **Version your models.** Like code, ArchiMate models should be version-controlled. Use tool exports (e.g., Archi Open Exchange format) stored alongside source code.
